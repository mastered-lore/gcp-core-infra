# Cloud Fabric FAST

Cloud Fabric FAST is a framework that provides a design and reference implementation for setting up a secure, production-ready Google Cloud Platform (GCP) organization. It aims to speed up the process of establishing a robust GCP environment by following best practices and addressing common challenges faced by enterprise customers.

## Guiding Principles

### Contracts and Stages

FAST is organized into stages, each responsible for a specific task or set of resources. These stages are designed around the security boundaries typically found in mature organizations, allowing for delegation of ownership to the appropriate teams. The stages are interconnected, with each stage defining its prerequisites, inputs, and outputs needed by other stages.

### Security-First Design

Security is a top priority in the FAST design. The first stage focuses on organization-wide security setup, while subsequent stages partition the organization hierarchy and implement guardrails for each branch. FAST aims to minimize the number of permissions granted to principals through the careful use of groups, service accounts, custom roles, and Cloud IAM Conditions.

### Extensive Use of Factories

FAST employs resource factories, which consume simple resource representations (e.g., YAML) and deploy them (e.g., using Terraform). This approach helps decrease the management overhead of large-scale infrastructure deployments.

### CI/CD Integration

FAST provides a lightweight reference design for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) repositories and a built-in implementation for running code in automated pipelines. It leverages Workload Identity Federation and includes sample workflow configurations for major CI/CD providers.

### Multitenant Support

FAST includes built-in support for multitenant organizations, implemented through an optional stage. Tenants can be created with FAST compatibility, allowing them to independently use stages in their own context.

## Implementation

FAST aims to be modular and customizable, allowing users to leverage different reference architectures as "pluggable modules." It provides a basic implementation and encourages users to modify the codebase if additional or different behavior is required.

The codebase follows principles such as:

- Avoiding magic and being as explicit as possible
- Hiding advanced features and complexity behind modules
- Preferring less indirection and flat over nested structures

Users are encouraged to customize FAST to their specific needs by removing or modifying stages or pieces of code that do not suit their requirements.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the FAST repository to your local environment.
2. Review the stages and their respective README files to understand their functionality and configuration options.
3. Customize the stages according to your organization's needs by modifying the code or removing unnecessary stages.
4. Configure the required variables and authentication mechanisms for your GCP environment.
5. Run the FAST stages in the recommended order, following the instructions provided in the documentation.

## Development and Contribution

FAST is designed to be extensible and customizable. If you need additional functionality or want to contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the FAST repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
3. Modify the code and add tests as necessary.
4. Ensure that all tests pass and your changes follow the project's coding guidelines.
5. Submit a pull request with a detailed description of your changes.

Refer to the project's contributing guidelines for more information on the development process and coding standards.
