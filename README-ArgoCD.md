# Cloud Fabric FAST with GitHub and ArgoCD

This README provides instructions for using Cloud Fabric FAST in conjunction with GitHub and ArgoCD for deploying and managing your GCP infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

- A GitHub repository forked or cloned from the Cloud Fabric FAST repository
- A GCP project or organization where you have the necessary permissions to deploy FAST
- ArgoCD installed and configured in your GCP environment

## GitHub Setup

1. Fork or clone the Cloud Fabric FAST repository to your GitHub account or organization.
2. Create a new branch for your customizations or modifications to the FAST codebase.
3. Commit your changes to the new branch and push them to your GitHub repository.

## ArgoCD Setup

1. Create a new ArgoCD application that points to your forked or cloned FAST repository on GitHub.
2. Configure the application to automatically sync and deploy changes from the branch you created earlier.
3. Set up any necessary secrets or credentials required for ArgoCD to access and deploy to your GCP environment.

## Deployment and Management

1. Make changes to the FAST codebase in your GitHub repository as needed.
2. Commit and push your changes to the branch you created earlier.
3. ArgoCD will automatically detect the new changes and begin synchronizing and deploying them to your GCP environment.
4. Monitor the ArgoCD user interface or logs to ensure that the deployment is successful and resolve any issues that may arise.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

FAST provides built-in support for CI/CD integration. You can leverage GitHub Actions or other CI/CD tools to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes for your FAST infrastructure.

1. Set up a CI/CD pipeline in your GitHub repository, triggered by commits or pull requests to your FAST branch.
2. Configure the pipeline to run tests, build artifacts (if applicable), and trigger ArgoCD to sync and deploy the changes.
3. Optionally, set up code review processes and approval workflows to ensure quality and security before deploying to production environments.

## Development and Collaboration

1. Create feature branches in your GitHub repository for new features or bug fixes.
2. Submit pull requests from your feature branches to the main branch (or a development branch, if desired).
3. Collaborate with your team by reviewing and discussing the proposed changes in the pull requests.
4. Once approved, merge the pull requests into the main branch.
5. ArgoCD will automatically sync and deploy the merged changes to your GCP environment.
